# app-servicios

This is an old project where I worked on the UI/UX with other colleagues I was the only designer. Sadly it never amount to much, the project was dropped.
The project consisted of showing electricians, plumbers, mechanics (car), you name it, and have their contact information on this app so the end user could 
arrange a visit to their house and have a worker have a look at the issue at hand.
